# Learn Prgramming Language 
Learn is the name of my personal programming language, 
designed as a way to explore the creation of a programming Language specification.
It is designed With a focus on reinforcing good memory management habits, 
while being simple and paired down enough to be quick to pick up and explore for first time programmers.   
While still providing plenty of flexabilty for large projects.
